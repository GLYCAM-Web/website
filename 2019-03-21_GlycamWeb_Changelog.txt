Began testing Taiga-GitHub integration.
  Integration exists, though it has limits.
  Issues can be added via GiHub, and those issues statuses can be edited via git commit messages.
  Limits exist though: git commit messages could not add a comment, only change the status.
  Currently testing comments and status changes to issues generated within Taiga.

Test was able to change the status, but never added a comment to the issue. Further tests needed.
